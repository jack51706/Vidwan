Reconnaissance using Google dorks

Vidwan is a simple tool which uses the exploit-db's GHDB database and other openly available google dorks for recon of an online domain.

Vidwan uses the google dorks from the local sqlite database and queries for a user supplied online domain and presents a list of links from Google. 

The project is currently under development and not in a usable state at present.
